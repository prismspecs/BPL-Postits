# BPL-Postits

Originally created for the Brooklyn Gaze installation at the Brooklyn Public Library. This app takes in images in realtime from any arbitrary folder and renders them as a postit note in a grid, which is then piped out via Syphon for your mapping pleasure. Coupled with the [canvas->dropbox drawing app](https://github.com/prismspecs/Canvas-Draw-to-Dropbox) this creates a powerful interactive installation.
